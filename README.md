**Introduction:**
Jungle Puzzle gives players the feel of an adventure game within the design of a puzzle platformer. While the player finds his way to obtain the diamonds, they will traverse the jungle terrain, dodging obstacles and monsters that will kill the player on contact. Any contacts with the enemies will have the player return to the beginning of the level. The game currently has 1 level and puzzle where the goal is to complete the level and make it to the exit where the game will be completed. The current puzzle uses a button for the player to step onto for a block(s) to appear for the player to figure out how to reach the end of the level.

**Game Mechanics:**
Bill: A stronger and brave adventurer that won't back down to sign of danger, but modest in character values. A is a man in his late 30s with a medium build. He desires to travel to new worlds and come across perilous ventures. His current motive is to be a traveling explorer finding gems for the queen.
Monsters: Every monster comes in various shapes and sizes. Each monster has their own traits and personality, but they'll have one common desire; to protect the gems in the face of intruders upon the lands. If anyone is seeking to pass through or take their jewels then their goal is to leave no survivors in sight.

**Game World Description**
Our main character goes on an adventure for his queen to find rare and exotic jewels for her esteemed collection. He must face perilous challenges in order to receive a gem at every destination he travels. The journey encompasses monsters at every stage and a puzzle that could either hinder his escape or be the light at the end of the tunnel. He only has one life at every place he ventures; traveling to monster invested jungles, cave dwellings, and volcanoes ready to rupture. He is sure to have the adventure of a lifetime to receive his queen's prized and sought out treasures.

Contributions:

**Chris Eoff:**
Puzzle Design - Responsible for the creative design and storyboarding of each end-level puzzle section in the game. Began by brainstorming possible puzzle layouts and sketching ideas. The next step was to storyboard the entire puzzle section, notating the specific mechanics and obstacles (i.e. multi-button presses, falling blocks, etc.), and map out the overall progression of the area. The final step was to build the area in Unity at the end of the levels that Jordan and Sanjana designed, ensuring that the areaâ€™s theming was consistent with what they had already built.

**Denice Hickethier:**
Main Menu - Edited free to use images for the main menu background, then design the GUI and subrelated menu for setting options to adjust audio. Also created scripts for the functionality of the menu. You are able to play the first level, go to the options setting where there is a toolbar setting for volume adjustments. Then back button to revert to the main menu and an exit button to leave the game. 
Pause Menu - Incorporated and created a pause menu GUI for the player to use when the gameplay is active. Works on every level and is incorporated with a resume button to go back to where you left off in the game, main menu button to go back to the main menu, and an exit button to quit the game whenever desired.
Audio - Incorporated background audio for atmospheric ambiance when playing each level. Added Audio Mixer and Volume Adjusting script. The audio can be manipulated by the side scroller found in the options menu from the main menu or pause menu when playing any of the levels. Found and added the mp3 music for the final editing of background music for the main menu and level 1, 2, and 3.
Testing - Tested bugs of level 3 and proper implementation of main menu, pause menu, and background audio.
Documentation - Created all reports edited and added padding to any section necessary. Contributed with the introduction, references, game story, and added padding to where necessary in the checkpoint report, and final report. Added demo video(s) to YouTube.

**Sanjan Balasubramanian:**
Environment(Level 1 and 3), Level design(Level 3), Audio Script, Audio,Documentation, Character and enemy, Testing and Game concept. 
Environment-  Create the environment for Level 1 and Level 3  to design the GUI for the game. In Level 1 and 3 there is a background and also each object such as the trees, mountains, sky, grass the platform and stones in the space is placed with the assets. Overall designed a creative GUI for the game scene.
Level Design(Level 3)- Designed and placed the necessary assets for the game. Downloaded the assets from the store and incorporated it in both. Also, contributed to designing a small portion puzzle in the scene. The first two puzzles in level 3.
Audio Script and Audio- Downloaded some free mp3 songs for background. Added Audio listener and background music for the main menu and Level1. 
Documentation- Contributed to writing half of the proposal(Game treatment) and final documentation.
Character and enemy-  The main character and the monster for the game was incorporated. The Character and enemy assets were placed by the free to use assets. 
Also wrote some scripts for audio such as every time the character jumps there would be some sound.
Testing -  Checking for any bugs in the program and scene.
Game Concept- The jungle theme game where the character has to tackle enemies in the game.

**Ryan Carroll:** 
Character Scripts: Wrote the scripts for the character to work with the prefab we downloaded, the character can move, jump, double jump, and dash, and has animations for running, jumping, and idle. OnCollision function detects enemies, buttons, and level exits.
Enemies: Added enemies and gave them the necessary components, wrote the scripts, enemy scripts were basic walking back and forth between two point
Scripts for puzzles: wrote scripts for buttons that interacted with each other, for example, one button would not be turned on til two other buttons were pressed at the same time. Buttons would drop blocks or move other game objects to allow the character to progress in the level
Level editing: Edited all 3 levels to work with the game scripts, moving blocks into the correct spot so jumps could be made, making sure everything was in correct z-dimension etc. 
Level Testing: Tested scripts for each character and enemy on each level after they were completed
Demonstration: recorded demonstration videos
